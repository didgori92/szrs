                <h3>Daily Food</h3>
                <p>Eating a wide variety of nutritious foods, including fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean protein can help support your overall health. Many foods are both healthy and tasty. By filling your plate with fruits, vegetables, quality protein sources, and other whole foods, you’ll have meals that are colorful, versatile, and good for you. The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight. Vegetables and fruit contain antioxidants and phytochemicals, or plant chemicals. These biologically active substances can help to protect you from some diseases.  Fruit is good for you, but what is the healthiest fruit? All fruit offer health benefits, so include as much variety as possible. 10 healthy fruit that are super nutritious: Apples, Blueberries, Bananas, Oranges, Dragon fruit, Mango, Avocado, Lychee, Pineapple and Strawberries. There is no single most healthy vegetable, but eating a variety of vegetables can improve health and well-being. Nutritious options to add to the diet include spinach, peas, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes. It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day . Women should have around 2,000 calories a day. Use the Healthy Eating Plate as a guide for creating healthy, balanced meals—whether served at the table or packed in a lunch box. </p>

                <h3>Physical Health</h3>
                <p>What is Physical Health? <br>
                    Physical health, also known as physical wellness, is more than just how fit you are. Physical health is how well your organs and body systems function. 
       each person’s version of physical health is different. Someone can achieve their own definition of physical health, despite a disease, a disability, or their age.

       <br><br>
       <ul>
                    <li>1. Stay Active
                        <br>Physical activity is the secret sauce to maintaining and improving your overall health.
                        <br>Engaging in regular exercise can work wonders, from burning calories to enhancing your mood, and boosting brain function.
                        <br>It contributes to improved heart health, better sleep, increased energy levels, and decreased risk for chronic diseases.
                        <br>The beauty of exercise is that it doesn’t need to be overly complex or intense.
                        <br>How to get started: Start with simple activities.
                        <br>Aim for 15 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a few times a week.
                        <br>Start with something simple like walking.
                        <br>As you build stamina, gradually incorporate more rigorous activities such as weight lifting, high-intensity interval training, or sports.
                        <br>Dabble in different fitness activities – from yoga classes to hiking trails – to discover what you enjoy.
                        <br>The key is to make exercise enjoyable, turning it into a regular habit rather than a chore. Consistency is vital</li>
                        <br><br>
                    <li>2. Eat a Balanced Diet
                        <br>Feeding your body with the right nutrients is essential for good health.
                        <br>A balanced diet ensures that your body gets a variety of nutrients it needs to function optimally.
                        <br>Eating a range of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats can reduce your risk of chronic diseases, improve longevity, and enhance your mood and energy levels.
                        <br>How to get started: Begin with educating yourself about different food groups and their nutritional value.
                        <br>Aim to balance your meals by including portions from each food group.
                        <br>Contrary to popular belief, a balanced diet doesn’t mean completely eliminating ‘bad’ foods.
                        <br>It’s about practicing moderation. Indulge in your favourite treats occasionally, but make sure that most of your dietary choices are nutrient-dense.
                        <br>Meal planning and preparation can go a long way in maintaining a balanced diet.
                        <br>It allows you to control ingredients, portion sizes, and ensures you always have a healthy meal on hand.</li>
                        <br><br>
                    <li>3. Stay Hydrated
                        <br>Staying well-hydrated is an essential part of good health.
                        <br>Water plays a key role in your body’s vital functions, from the digestion and absorption of nutrients to maintaining your body’s temperature and flushing out waste and toxins.
                        <br>Additionally, it contributes to mental clarity, healthy skin, and aids in weight management.
                        <br>Dehydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, dry skin, and in severe cases, heat stroke.
                        <br>How to get started: Start with the general recommendation of 2 litres of water per day.
                        <br>However, remember that your needs can vary based on your physical activity level, age, and other factors.
                        <br>Make it a habit to carry a water bottle with you wherever you go.
                        <br>If you find plain water unappealing, you can enhance its flavour by infusing it with a lemon, lime, or other fruit.</li>
                        <br><br>
                    <li>4. Get Adequate Sleep
                        <br>Adequate, quality sleep is a cornerstone of health that’s as important as nutritious food and regular exercise.
                        <br>Good sleep enhances mood, boosts the immune system, sharpens brain function, and can even help control weight.
                        <br>Chronic lack of sleep can lead to serious health conditions like heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, and negatively impact mental health.
                        <br>How to get started: Prioritise sleep by setting a regular sleep schedule, aiming for 7-9 hours each night, and try to stick to it, even on weekends.
                        <br>Ensure your sleeping environment is conducive to good sleep: dark, quiet, and cool.
                        <br>Establish relaxing bedtime routines like reading a book, listening to calming music, or taking a warm bath.
                        <br>Limit exposure to screens before bedtime as the blue light emitted can interfere with your sleep cycle.
                        <br>If you struggle with sleep, consider seeking professional advice.</li>
                        <br><br>
                    <li>5. Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking
                        <br>Limiting alcohol and avoiding smoking are critical steps towards better health.
                        <br>Excessive alcohol can lead to liver damage, certain cancers, and can negatively impact mental health.
                        <br>Smoking increases the risk of various diseases, including lung cancer and heart disease.
                        <br>How to get started: If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation.
                        <br>Aim to drink less than weekly recommendation of 14 units.
                        <br>For smoking, the best choice is to quit completely.
                        <br>Reach out to health professionals or local support groups to help with the quitting process, which can be challenging but immensely beneficial to your health.

            <h3>Body Mass Index</h3>
            <p>BMI, otherwise known as the Body Mass Index, is an Index developed by Belgian Astronomer, Mathematician, Statistician, and Sociologist Adolf Quetelet, who created the basis of it during anywhere between the 1830's and 1850's. Quetelet himself admittited that he never intended for the index to be used for medical assessment, but rather, studying l'homme moyen, or, the average man.
                <br>The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
                <br>The index is used differently for youth of different ages, but, it is largely the same when it comes to measuring adults.
                <br>The index was developed as a result of increasing levels of overweight/obese populations within western societys as a result of the industrial revolution and the modernization of countries, which decreased the workload on daily human lifes by replacing the needed human force with much stronger machines, resulting in less physical activity in people's lives, which meant they were more likely to gain weight.

                <br>
                <br>The image above shows a chart of BMI with different colours, starting off with underweight, shown in a light blue, followed by normal weight in  green, then overweight in yellow, moderately obese in orange, severely overweight in the darker orange, and finally, very severely obese in red.
                <br>On top of all these different weight classes, all come with their health risks. obesity for example can lead a person into developing heart issues, type 2 diabetes, muscoskeleton disorders, and even some forms of cancer, and even overall decreasing a persons life span by several years.
                <br>There are several factors that can contribute to a person becoming overweight, which goes as the following: lack of physical activity, high amounts of stress, unhealthy eating habits, not getting good quality sleep, health conditions, genetics, medicines, and the person's environment.
