/*
differnces between for and while loops:
for loops are used when the number of iterations of the loop is known beforehand
while loops are used when the number of iterations is not known
a for loop has a given condition to continue the loop to
a while loop continues until a specified condition becomes false

while and for loops have a few similarities:
both are used to repeat a block of code multiple times
both can continue forever if the condition is always true

while loops are better for when you dont know how many times you want to loop
for loops are better when you do know how many times you want to loop
