<!-- RBG and Hex Code, what are they? -->
<!-- RGB is a shortened version of Red Green Blue, which is a form of code you can use to determine the colour of a text, image, header, background etc etc. -->
<!-- Hex Code does the same thing as RGB, but in a different way -->
<!-- RGB uses 3 colours, red, green and blue, with a maximum of 255, and a minimum of 0, which allows the user to show different colours with different intensities of the 3 colours mentioned, allowing them to freely navigate the vast ranges of colours without needing to name each of them individually -->
<!-- at the same time, while Hex Code does the same, it uses a different method, with rather than going 0-255, it goes 0 to 9, and then from A to F. Hex Code uses 2 symbols per colour, for example, FF0000 in RGB would be 255, 0, 0, meaning bright red. -->
 <!-- both of these are very regularly used, with obviously people having personal preferences (such as me with RGB), but in the end, both will work just fine -->
