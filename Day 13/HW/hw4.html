    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h4>Name</h4>
    <p>My full name is Levani Koba's Dze Gendzekhadze, having taken the name of my grandfather</p>
    <h4>My Personality</h4>
    <p>My personality lets me be classed as a sort of outcast from society, as i am shy, and generally prefer to be alone than around people. in person, i try to be as kind as i can to people, while also staying silent to not bother others.</p>
    <h4>My Interests</h4>
    <p>I am generally interested in history, with a bit of biology and science, and recently picked up an interest in programming after signing up in GOA. obviously we cannot forget gaming, as it is essentially a core part of modern society. my interests in gaming moreso involve strategy, with obviously its own action and level of "chill". I also like to watch the small indie series "murder drones" on the side.</p>
    <h4>Am I A Likeable Person?</h4>
    <p>Great question, and your answer would be: higly depends. 
    <br>It highly depends on wether or not you wish to like me or not, which doesnt really concern me, as i prefer to be myself, and am not very much interested in making a million friends, rather, i prefer to stick to my group.</p>
