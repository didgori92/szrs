  <h1>The Battle of Didgori</h1>
  <p>The Battle of Didgori is without a doubt the most important battle in georgian history, not just for Georgia, but for all south caucasians in the 12th century.
    <br>having took place on the 12th of August, 1121, the largerly outnumbered Georgian army met the muslim coalition in the fields near the village Didgori. while total numbers do vary according to different sources, in our times it is widely accepted that the Turk-Seljuk force consisted of about 300,000 soldiers, while the Georgian one of only 55,600.
    <br>the battle did not last long, only about 4 hours before the seljuk army was in complete dissaray and retreating from the georgians.
    <br>before it began, David IV had sent up to 100 kipchaks to the seljuks, with the seljuks confusing them for traitors and letting them deep within their ranks. David's son quietly sat on the hills nearby hidden away, as a reserve. the 100 kipchaks, after being ordered to drop their weapons suddenly began cutting up the seljuk forces, causing massive confusion, during which the main attack came. all this confusion, as well as the seljuk inability to properly spread out its army led to a complete collapse of their lines, not to forgot Demetre arriving in their side with the reserves.
    <br>after realizing what had happened. ilghazi, along with what was left of his man retreated, being followed and cut down by the georgians for several kilometeres. in the end, about 90% of the seljuk forces were killed, with 5% being captured, and the rest getting away
