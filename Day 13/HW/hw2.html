    <h1>GOA</h1>
    <h3>What is "GOA?"</h3>
    <p>GOA is an online academy in Georgia, which is here to teach the future generation how to code, on top of many other things.</P>
    <h3>What is it like in GOA?</h3>
    <p>In GOA, you will be met with a very kind and welcoming community, regardless of your age or gender. 
    <br>Here in GOA, you wont have to worry about getting lost looking for your room, or the building you study in, as all the lessons happen online, in Discord.
    <br>In GOA, you will be helped out in every way possible by your mentors, or even group members in order to make sure you understand everything correctly and know what to do. on top of this, each lesson will go over what you will be learning in said lesson in great detail so that nobody gets confused, and feel free to ask questions if you have any!</P>
    <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
    <p>My person experience so far has been amazing, as it has finally shown me what i truly want to learn for the future, while not being stressfull and relatively fun. while i do have moments where i am lazy and/or not willing to attend the next lesson, i still do, as it is better to do it then and there than later.</p>
    <h4>Would I Reccomend GOA?</h4>
    <p>Absolutely! it is a great place to learn programming, web development and more, while also having time for yourself and not having to spend endless nights staying up late and studying. this is a great opportunity for you to develop yourself and set yourself up for a successful future!</p>
