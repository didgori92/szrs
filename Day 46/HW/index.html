            content - the content in the box model is the center most piece where all the contents of the website are stored
            padding - the padding in the box model is the space between the content and the border around it; the higher the padding, the further the content is from the border
            border - the border in the box model is the space which outlines the content, meant to seperate the content and make the website look better
            margin - the margin in the box model is the outermost layer which outlines the border and is transparent; margin can be used to create an extra space outside borders to prevent overlapping

            block and inline elements

            block elements - block elements take up the entire space available on the screen unless styled otherwise, such as div, p, nav, ul/ol, form and others

            inline elements - inline elements take up only the needed space on the screen and no further, such as a, label, br, img, input, button and so on
