<h3>Number 5: Stalingrad</h3>

<p>Stalingrad is a book written by Antony Beevor, an English Historian about the most brutal battle of all of World War 2, the battle of Stalingrad. The book begins with Operation Barbarossa in 1941, when the Third Reich invaded the Soviet Union, and it leads up to its main focus, Stalingrad. the book manages to describe the brutality and the harsh enviorment of the battle very accurately, being able to immerse you into what was, hell on earth, with intense close quarters fighting between the Soviet and Axis forces to keep the city in their respective hands, as it served a major purpose in supplying the Caucasus.</p>

<p>All Quiet On The Western Front is a book about the Western Front during the Great War/World War 1, and is written by Erich Maria Remarque, a German Veteran of the Western Front. in his book, Remarque talks about the horrors that was trench warfare, and just how unforgiving it was. in the book, Remarque points out the insane phsycological and physical stress that soldiers went through during the war, living under constant enemy shelling, having to murder hundereds if not thousands if the enemy went over the top, and in fear of hearing the commander blow his whistle, signaling his troops to go over the top, where many would die in no mans land and be left behind. me personally would higly reccommend reading it and understanding just how harsh the front really was</p>


<p>unfortunately, as I am not much of a book reader myself, these are the only ones I have enjoyed, but I will refrain from adding any more which I have no idea about.</p>
