<h1>HTML, CSS and JS</h1>

HTML was created for creating websites and allowing people across the globe to access many things easily, and to make life more convenient and allow people to save more time, which otherwise woudlve been used on others things. web development is often compared to the human body, where HTML serves as the structure of the website, or in other words, the "bones"</P>
<p>JavaScript, otherwise known as JS is a programming language and a core part of the web, together with HTML and CSS. JS is used for giving a website a more dynamic and interactive interface. JS gives the website more functions, and allows the users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page. by using JS, coders can create more user friendly websites. JS when compared to human anatomy is considered as the "nerves" of the website.</p>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or for short, CSS, is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is often used together with HTML and JS. CSS was first published in 1996. CSS is, as suggested by the name, for giving the website a bit more style, being able to for example, change text fonts, add colour, change text sizes and so on. CSS in human anatomy is compared to the outside structure of a human, which essentially means that it is there for the website to look good.</p>
